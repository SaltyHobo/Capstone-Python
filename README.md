# Capstone-Python
Capstone project from the Python For Everybody specialization of Coursera. 
Specialization created by University of Michigan.
Taught by Associate Professor Charles Severance.

The purpose of this project was to build a small program using Python language that will connect to the CDC Wonder API and access the Daily Fine Particulate Matter xml data. From here the program will create a SQLite database with total daily fine particulate matter for each year in each U.S. county. The program will then prompt user input for which year they want to display, and whether they want to display counties with the highest or lowest fine particulate matter. Depending on the input, the program will then display the top 25 counties of either highest or lowest fine particulate matter.

A second program gword.py, included, can be used to access the SQLite database and build a small Javascript file, which is then used to visualize the results into an html word cloud.

(note1: CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
(note2: cap.py = capstone file)
(note3: gword.py = creates javascript file gword.js)
(note4: gword.htm = creates wordcloud using data from gword.js and instructions from d3.v2.js and d3.layout.cloud.js)
